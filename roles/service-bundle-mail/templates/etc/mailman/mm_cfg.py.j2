"""This is the module which takes your site-specific settings.

From a raw distribution it should be copied to mm_cfg.py.  If you
already have an mm_cfg.py, be careful to add in only the new settings
you want.  The complete set of distributed defaults, with annotation,
are in ./Defaults.  In mm_cfg, override only those you want to
change, after the

  from Defaults import *

line (see below).

Note that these are just default settings - many can be overridden via the
admin and user interfaces on a per-list or per-user basis.

Note also that some of the settings are resolved against the active list
setting by using the value as a format string against the
list-instance-object's dictionary - see the distributed value of
DEFAULT_MSG_FOOTER for an example."""

# If the following is set to a non-empty string, this string in combination
# with the time, list name and the IP address of the requestor is used to
# create a hidden hash as part of the subscribe form on the listinfo page.
# This hash is checked upon form submission and the subscribe fails if it
# doesn't match.  I.e. the form posted must be first retrieved from the
# listinfo CGI by the same IP that posts it.  The subscribe also fails if
# the time the form was retrieved is more than the above FORM_LIFETIME or less
# than the below SUBSCRIBE_FORM_MIN_TIME before submission.
# Important: If you have any static subscribe forms on your web site, setting
# this option will break them.  With this option set, subscribe forms must be

# signatures.  It is generally felt that these signatures have value, even if
# broken and even if the outgoing message is resigned.  However, some sites
# may wish to remove these headers.  Possible values and meanings are:
# No, 0, False -> do not remove headers.
# Yes, 1, True -> remove headers only if we are munging the from header due
#                 to from_is_list or dmarc_moderation_action.

#
# The envelope sender is set by the SMTP delivery and is thus less easily
# spoofed than the sender, which is typically just taken from the From: header
# and thus easily spoofed by the end-user.  However, sometimes the envelope
# sender isn't set correctly and this will manifest itself by postings being
# held for approval even if they appear to come from a list member.  If you
# are having this problem, set this variable to No, but understand that some
# spoofed messages may get through.
